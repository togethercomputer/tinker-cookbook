# Tinker Cookbook Agent Guide

Quick reference for agents working on `tinker-cookbook`. Detailed guidance is in the skills under `skills/`.

`tinker-cookbook` is a client library with training and eval code built on the Tinker service (hosted by Thinking Machines Lab) and the Tinker SDK (a separate repo with just the API). You author training/eval loops that run on a CPU machine; Tinker executes the heavy GPU work.

**Skills:** This repo ships three Claude Code skills in `skills/`: `research` (SFT, RL, DPO, distillation, evaluation, model selection, experiment methodology), `debug` (performance, correctness, renderer, and error triage), and `inkling` (thinking effort, rendering, post-training, and multimodal input for Inkling series models). Install via `/plugin marketplace add thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook`, then use `/tinker:research`, `/tinker:debug`, or `/tinker:inkling`.

## Composing Types

Agents often struggle with the nested type hierarchy.

**Core types:**

- `Datum` = `model_input` (ModelInput) + `loss_fn_inputs` (dict of TensorData)
- `ModelInput` = list of chunks (EncodedTextChunk, ImageChunk)
- `TensorData` = wrapper for numpy/torch arrays with shape info

**Helper functions** (use these instead of manual construction):

- `datum_from_model_input_weights(model_input, weights, max_length)` - SL datum creation (`supervised/common.py`)
- `conversation_to_datum(messages, renderer, max_length, train_on_what)` - Full pipeline (`supervised/data.py`)
- `renderer.build_supervised_example(messages)` - Returns (ModelInput, weights)
- `ModelInput.from_ints(tokens)` - Create from token list
- `TensorData.from_numpy(arr)` / `TensorData.from_torch(tensor)` - Wrap arrays

## Architecture

**Builder pattern:** Config objects are `chz` dataclasses (SupervisedDatasetBuilder, RLDatasetBuilder, EnvGroupBuilder). They expose `.build()`/`__call__()` returning runtime objects.

**Key code locations:**

- SL: `tinker_cookbook/supervised/train.py`
- RL: `tinker_cookbook/rl/train.py`
- DPO: `tinker_cookbook/preference/train_dpo.py`
- Renderers: `tinker_cookbook/renderers/`
- Completers: `tinker_cookbook/completers.py`
- RL types: `tinker_cookbook/rl/types.py`
- Rollout strategies: `tinker_cookbook/rl/rollout_strategy.py` (FailFast, RetryOnFailure)
- Logging: `tinker_cookbook/utils/logtree.py`, `tinker_cookbook/rl/rollouts.py`
- Recipes: `tinker_cookbook/recipes/`

**Training outputs:** RL and SL training write human-readable HTML reports and machine-readable JSON files (metrics, rollout transcripts, per-trajectory summaries) to `log_path`. Point agents at a `log_path` directory to analyze training runs — `metrics.jsonl` for scalar metrics, `*_rollout_summaries.jsonl` for per-trajectory data, and `*_logtree.json` for full rollout transcripts including model responses.

## Conventions

**Subscript suffixes** for tensor names: `_P` (problems), `_G` (groups), `_T` (tokens), `_D` (datums). Example: `tokens_P_G_T[p][g][t]`

**Code style:**

- Explicit typing; avoid `Any` / `type: ignore`
- Use `safezip`, `timed`, `scope` helpers
- `@chz.chz` decorator for config serialization
- `ml_log.log_metrics` for metrics; `logtree` for transcripts

**Env lifecycle:** `Env` objects are single-use (no reset). Create via `EnvGroupBuilder`.

## Public-repo discipline

`tinker-cookbook` is a public repository. Keep internal context out of commits (even intermediate commits), and write with an external audience in mind.

## Finding supported models

For an identifier to pass to the SDK, call `service_client.get_server_capabilities().supported_models` — authoritative, includes `:peft:` long-context variants, but requires `TINKER_API_KEY`. For a read-only lookup with pricing and context length (no auth), browse <https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/models/>.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Sequential API calls:** The #1 performance mistake. Always use `_async` variants and submit calls back-to-back before awaiting. Use `asyncio.gather` for concurrent evaluation — never sequential loops over API calls. Tinker is designed for high request concurrency from a single Python process; when exact limits matter, check the current SDK/client configuration rather than inventing small caps. For very high parallelism, shard work across multiple Python processes and pass pickled sampling clients where appropriate.

2. **Client-side timeouts and retries:** Don't wrap Tinker requests in your own timeouts (e.g. `asyncio.wait_for` around `sample_async`) or retry loops. The SDK and backend already retry transient failures, and the SDK detects stuck requests. Tinker is optimized for throughput over latency, so request latency varies with system load and generation length; there is no correct fixed timeout. Under load, aggressive timeouts turn slow-but-progressing steps into total failure (every request in a batch times out, retries just add load), which especially bites RL sampling loops that bound per-batch sampling time. Submit requests concurrently and wait for them; slow steps resolve on their own. Reserve `RetryOnFailure` / `per_rollout_timeout` for non-Tinker failures (flaky sandboxes, tool errors), not as a bound on sampling latency. If sampling speed is dramatically blocking your training jobs, email support (<https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/support/>) with your session ID.

3. **Sampler desync:** Create a **new** sampling client after saving weights. A stale client silently samples from old weights.

4. **LoRA LR:** Use `hyperparam_utils.get_lr(model_name)` - LoRA needs ~10x higher LR than full fine-tuning.

5. **Renderer mismatch:** Use `model_info.get_recommended_renderer_name()` — never hardcode renderer names.

   **Never call `tokenizer.encode(prompt)` directly on a chat-tuned model** (gpt-oss, Llama-3-Instruct, Qwen-Instruct, etc.). Raw encoding skips the chat template, producing OOD prompt tokens. The sampler and trainer then take subtly different code paths on those OOD inputs, and per-token sampler/trainer logprob KL can inflate by 5×+ (max ratios in the tens), silently breaking PPO/CISPO/GRPO importance ratios. Use `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True)` (take `["input_ids"]` from the returned `BatchEncoding`) or a cookbook renderer for the prompt. Raw `encode` is correct only for base / continued-pretraining / NLL-eval workflows where there is no conversation.

6. **Context length:** Be mindful of the context length of the model you pick. Each model's maximum sequence length is listed on <https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/models/>, and sequences that exceed it get truncated or rejected. For long-horizon tasks (multi-turn agentic RL, long tool-use trajectories, long documents), always prefer the extended-context variant of the model if one is available — these are the `:peft:<length>` model IDs in `get_server_capabilities().supported_models` (e.g. `...:peft:131072` for 128K, `...:peft:262144` for 256K). Also check trajectory caps like `max_trajectory_tokens` and datum `max_length` — a model with a large context window still truncates if the loop's limits are smaller.

7. **Type construction:** Use helper functions, not manual dict construction. See `supervised/data.py` and `supervised/common.py`.

8. **Group semantics:** RL advantages are centered within each group.

9. **DPO:** Start with `dpo_beta=0.1`, LR~1e-5.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (no API needed, colocated *_test.py files)
pytest tinker_cookbook/

# Smoke tests (requires TINKER_API_KEY + network)
pytest tests/
```

For debugging, shrink workloads via `n_batches`, `batch_size`, `group_size` in dataset builders.
