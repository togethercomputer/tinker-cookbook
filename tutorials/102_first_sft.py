    # Tutorial 102: Your First Supervised Fine-Tuning Run

    In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a language model using supervised learning (SFT). By the end, you will have:

    1. Built training data from chat messages using a **renderer**
    2. Run `forward_backward` and `optim_step` to update model weights
    3. Watched the loss decrease over multiple steps
    4. Sampled from the trained model to verify it learned

    **Our task:** We will teach the model a new identity -- "Tinker Tinker", a helpful assistant that knows about the Tinker training platform and the tinker-cookbook project. Before training, the model knows nothing about Tinker. After training, it should answer questions about Tinker accurately and in character.

    ## Build training data

    Supervised fine-tuning teaches a model to produce specific outputs for specific inputs. We need to convert chat-style messages into the token format that Tinker expects.

    The key type is `Datum`, which contains:
    - `model_input`: the token sequence fed into the model
    - `loss_fn_inputs`: target tokens and per-token weights (1 = train on this token, 0 = ignore)

    The `conversation_to_datum` helper does this conversion for us. It uses a **renderer** to apply the model's chat template and mark which tokens to train on.

    ## Next steps

    In this tutorial, you trained both a 4B and a frontier-class model with the same code -- no GPU setup, no infrastructure changes. That is the core value of Tinker.

    - **Efficient sampling** shows how to run many inference requests concurrently for maximum throughput. See `tutorials/103_async_patterns.py`.
    - **Real training loops** iterate over a full dataset with proper batching and evaluation. See `tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_loop.py`.
    - **Renderers** handle chat templates, vision inputs, and per-token weight assignment. See the [Rendering docs](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tutorials/core-concepts/rendering/).
